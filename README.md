## Overview
This project is an innovative assistive technology solution aimed at improving navigation and safety for visually impaired users. The glove integrates multiple sensors, real-time data acquisition, and intelligent control logic to deliver smooth, intuitive feedback to the user.

It strengthens skills in sensor integration, signal processing, hardware-software integration, and user-centered design, demonstrating the real-world impact of inclusive engineering.

## Features

### üîπ Obstacle Detection
- Uses an **Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure distance every 500 ms.
- Maintains an **8-sample moving average (4 seconds)** to eliminate false triggers.
- **Vibration feedback** is activated if the average distance is less than 1.5 meters.
- Smooth response designed for dynamic environments.

### üå°Ô∏è Body Temperature Monitoring
- Monitors temperature using **LM35 Sensor** every 5 seconds.
- Maintains a **10-value moving average (50 seconds)** for stability.
- **Buzzer alert** triggers if temperature drops below normal levels for early detection of health issues.

### üñêÔ∏è Gesture-Controlled Interaction
- Two **custom flex sensors** on fingers.
- **Middle finger bent for 3 seconds** turns off the buzzer.
- **Index finger bent for 3 seconds** sends a Telegram alert to a guardian.
- Logic prevents simultaneous gestures from causing misfires.

## Hardware
- **NI DAQ Card** for real-time data acquisition  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** for obstacle detection  
- **LM35 Sensor** for body temperature monitoring  
- **Flex Sensors** for gesture detection  

---

## Software
- **LabVIEW** for signal processing, control logic, and UI design  
- Modular logic implemented with timing control, thresholding, and state management  

---

## How It Works
1. Sensors continuously monitor distance, body temperature, and finger gestures.  
2. Data is processed in LabVIEW with real-time control logic.  
3. Vibrations and buzzer alerts are triggered based on threshold conditions.  
4. Gesture-based commands allow the user to interact with the glove without physical switches.  
5. Optional Telegram alerts notify guardians in case of emergencies.
